##DISCRIPTION :-
API Integration:
In this project, we implemented API integration to fetch real-time or external data using Python. An API (Application Programming Interface) allows communication between two software systems. We used the requests library in Python to send HTTP requests to a public API and retrieve data in JSON format. This data was then parsed and used for further processing or visualization.

What we did:
Sent a GET request to a public API endpoint.
Received data in JSON format.
Extracted useful information from the response using .json() method.
Printed or processed that data within the program.

Data Visualization:
Once we had the data, we visualized it using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Data visualization helps in understanding patterns, trends, and outliers by representing data in the form of charts and graphs.

What we did:
Cleaned and prepared the data for visualization.
Plotted charts such as bar graphs, line plots, and pie charts using matplotlib.pyplot.
Used seaborn for advanced visualizations like heatmaps for better interpretation.
Added titles, axis labels, and legends to improve readability.

Tools & Libraries Used:
1)Python
2)requests
3)matplotlib
4)seaborn

Platform Used:- Visual Studio Code
